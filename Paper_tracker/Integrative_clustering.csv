Most current approaches to multisource clustering either independently determine a separate clustering for each data source or determine a single ‘joint’ clustering for all data sources. There is a need for more flexible approaches that simultaneously model the dependence and the heterogeneity of the data sources.",2013-10-15,2019-11-13 14:17:35,2019-11-13 14:17:35,2019-11-13 14:17:35,2610-2616,,20,29,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/JDKACSKT/Lock and Dunson - 2013 - Bayesian consensus clustering.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lock, Eric F.; Dunson, David B."

However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels. We evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.",2017-10-16,2019-11-13 14:17:37,2019-11-13 14:17:37,2019-11-13 14:17:37,e1005781,,10,13,,PLoS Comput Biol,Clusternomics,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/WFLZPB5I/Gabasova et al. - 2017 - Clusternomics Integrative context-dependent clust.pdf,,,,"Morris, Quaid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gabasova, Evelina; Reid, John; Wernisch, Lorenz"

Genomic proﬁling at these multiple levels should allow an integrated characterization of tumor etiology.

The standard approach to integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual integration.

Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct—but often complementary—information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI’s performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation–chip and protein–protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques—as well as to non-integrative approaches—demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.",2012-12,2019-11-13 14:17:50,2019-11-13 14:17:51,2019-11-13 14:17:50,3290-3297,,24,28,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/R2LYT2D4/Kirk et al. - 2012 - Bayesian correlated clustering to integrate multip.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kirk, Paul; Griffin, Jim E.; Savage, Richard S.; Ghahramani, Zoubin; Wild, David L."

However, ML technologies do not come without their limitations and shortcomings. Current technical limitations and other limitations including governance, reproducibility, and interpretation will be discussed in this article. Overcoming these limitations will enable ML methods to be more powerful for discovery and reduce ambiguity within translational medicine, allowing data-informed decision-making to deliver the next generation of diagnostics and therapeutics to patients quicker, at lowered costs, and at scale.",2019-09,2019-11-13 14:18:14,2019-11-13 14:18:14,2019-11-13 14:18:14,607-615,,,47,,EBioMedicine,Looking beyond the hype,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/FT9ZZND8/Toh et al. - 2019 - Looking beyond the hype Applied AI and machine le.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Toh, Tzen S.; Dondelinger, Frank; Wang, Dennis"
