```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This document is a list of the papers I have read. The intention is to track 
authors, institutes and journals a little bit more thoroughly than I have been.

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
integrative_journals <- read.csv("Integrative_clustering.csv")
to_read <- read.csv("To_read.csv")
```

## Integrative clustering methods

```{r integrative_clustering_journals, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(integrative_journals[1:5, c(5, 4, 6, 3)])
```

## To read

```{r to_read_journals, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(to_read[, c(5, 4, 6, 3)])
```
