Here, we describe a previously unknown lymphocyte that is a dual expresser (DE) of TCR and BCR and key lineage markers of both B and T cells. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), DEs are predominated by one clonotype that encodes a potent CD4 T cell autoantigen in its antigen binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this peptide has an optimal binding register for diabetogenic HLADQ8. In concordance, a synthetic version of the peptide forms stable DQ8 complexes and potently stimulates autoreactive CD4 T cells from T1D patients, but not healthy controls. Moreover, mAbs bearing this clonotype are autoreactive against CD4 T cells and inhibit insulin tetramer binding to CD4 T cells. Thus, compartmentalization of adaptive immune cells into T and B cells is not absolute, and violators of this paradigm are likely key drivers of autoimmune diseases.","2019-05","2019-11-13 14:19:20","2019-11-13 14:19:20","2019-11-13 14:19:20","1583-1599.e16","","6","177","","Cell","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/W34YAEKW/Ahmed et al. - 2019 - A Public BCR Present in a Unique Dual-Receptor-Exp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider a general framework for nonparametric Bayes joint modeling through mixture models that incorporate dependence across data types through a joint mixing measure. The mixing measure is assigned a novel inﬁnite tensor factorization (ITF) prior that allows ﬂexible dependence in cluster allocation across data types. The ITF prior is formulated as a tensor product of stick-breaking processes. Focusing on a convenient special case corresponding to a Parafac factorization, we provide basic theory justifying the ﬂexibility of the proposed prior and resulting asymptotic properties. Focusing on ITF mixtures of product kernels, we develop a new Gibbs sampling algorithm for routine implementation relying on slice sampling. The methods are compared with alternative joint mixture models based on Dirichlet processes and related approaches through simulations and real data applications.","","2019-11-13 14:19:21","2019-11-13 14:19:21","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/JWU76EPZ/Banerjee et al. - Bayesian learning of joint distributions of object.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) includes data from several diverse genomic technologies on the same cancerous tumor samples. In this paper we introduce Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), a general decomposition of variation for the integrated analysis of such datasets. The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. JIVE quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data, and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structure. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares. A JIVE analysis of gene expression and miRNA data on Glioblastoma Multiforme tumor samples reveals gene-miRNA associations and provides better characterization of tumor types.","2013-03","2019-11-13 14:19:23","2019-11-13 14:19:23","2019-11-13 14:19:23","523-542","","1","7","","Ann.

Clustering algorithms are often used for this purpose. However, gene regulatory events may induce complex temporal features in a gene expression proﬁle, including time delays, inversions and transient correlations, which are not well accounted for by current clustering methods. As the cost of microarray experiments continues to fall, the temporal resolution of time course studies is increasing. This has led to a need to take account of detailed temporal features of this kind. Thus, while standard clustering methods are both widely used and much studied, their shared shortcomings with respect to such temporal features motivates the work presented here.","2010-02-01","2019-11-13 14:19:25","2019-11-13 14:19:25","2019-11-13 14:19:25","355-362","","3","26","","Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/stephen/Zotero/storage/9BS9TH8L/Kiddle et al. - 2010 - Temporal clustering by affinity propagation reveal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
