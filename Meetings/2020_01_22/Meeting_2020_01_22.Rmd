## Summary

* Update paper concept to refer to:
  * Introduction:
    * Consensus clustering + (R package);
    * Bagging - concept of an ensemble of weak learners performing really well.
  * Discussion:
    * In problems acknowledge lack of theoretical argument, but point out effectiveness of machine learning techniques suchas ensemble methods and bagging and their empirical worth.
* Move to MATLAB code entirely (suspicious of high Phi values and of command line code generally);
* Transfer Gaussian mixture component to Paul's MATLAB;
* Test this - check derivations in code and test onf MDItestdata from original MDI paper;
* Apply to TGCA data as manipulated for the BCC paper; and
* Apply to Pan-Cancer dataset (to receive from Paul).
