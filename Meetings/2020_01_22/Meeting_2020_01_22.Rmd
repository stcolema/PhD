## Summary

* Move to MATLAB code entirely (suspicious of high Phi values and of command line code generally);
* Transfer Gaussian mixture component to Paul's MATLAB;
* Test this - check derivations in code and test onf MDItestdata from original MDI paper;
* Apply to TGCA data as manipulated for the BCC paper; and
* Apply to Pan-Cancer dataset (to receive from Paul).
