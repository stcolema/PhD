## Summary

This meeting was more "touch-base" than anything else. The following were discussed:

* Working from elsewhere: use the group calendar.
* Make a noting system that Chris can find for meetings.
  + Consider a repo where weekly summaries can also live?
* Re-stated plan to create summary docs of different integrative clustering methods.
* Biology lectures.
