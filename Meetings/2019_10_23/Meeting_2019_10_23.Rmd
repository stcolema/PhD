## Summary

* Discussed the Clusternomics model and specifically the problems with the R package.
  * Recommended to ask Paul if model is woth the time to fix code (in his opinion);
  * If so, try looking at an older release and checking the results of the tutorial with this.
* Plan is to produce a markdown of Bayesian Consensus Clustering (and then iCluster).
