## Summary

* Check how NAs are handled in pre-processing of BCC TCGA data.
* Mention ``mclust`` and ``tabulation`` to Eckart; look at Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (and ``BHC`` the Bioconductor package). Also, log transform count data.
* Latex derviation of collapsed gibbs sampler for mixture allocation for the general model and the gaussian case.
* Test Gaussian mixtures in MDI on a simple simulation of standard normal data with a diagonal covariance matrix.
* Look at Bayesian hierarchical clustering and associated ``BHC`` package (on Bioconductor).
