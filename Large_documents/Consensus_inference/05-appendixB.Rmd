# Clustering as a form of dimension reduction {#dimRed}

Cluster analysis consists of defining partitions of the items within a dataset 
such that the resulting sets are homogeneous and distinct from one another. One
does this by identifying some latent variable that defines the groupings. 
Considered this way cluster analysis consists of mapping a multi-dimensional,
complex dataset to a $K$-dimensional binary matrix where each column indicates
membership in the $K$ cluster. Thus it may be considered as a constrained form
of dimension reduction. This is a useful way to think about cluster analysis as
many of the problems that exists when thinking about dimension reduction have a 
parallel in the clustering world. For instance, when thinking about dimension 
reduction one has to choose:

* between linear and non-linear methods;
* between model-based and heuristic methods; and
* the number of dimensions to reduce to.
